1. 	
	If: 	
		there are three to six people present
	Then:
		give everyone 5 cards.		
Else:

	Give the 2 players 7 cards.


2. All remaining cards are placed face down in a pile.


3. First, choose a player to go first.


4. On each person's turn, ask any player for a specific card rank.  


You must already hold at least one card of the rank you ask for.


5. 	
	If:
 		the player you ask has any cards of the requested rank.

	Then:   
		she must give all of her cards of that rank to you.


6. 
	If: 		
		you get one or more cards from the player you ask.

	Then:
		you get another turn.


7. 
	It starts again and you may ask any player for any rank you already hold, including the same one you just asked for. 
  

	If: 
		the person you ask has no relevant cards.
	Then:
		they say, "Go fish."


8. You then draw the top card from the draw pile. You add the drawn card to your hand.





10. Go Fish continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the draw pile runs out.


11. The winner is the player who then has the most matches (sets of four).
